# Spring Boot multi-level cache starter

Opinionated version of multi-level caching for [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) with [Redis](https://redis.io/) as L2 (remote) cache and [Caffeine](https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine) as L1 (local) cache with a Circuit Breaker pattern for L2 cache calls.

This version does not allow setting most of the local cache properties in favor of managing local cache expiry by itself.

## Use cases

### Suitable for
- Microservices working with immutable cached entities under low latency requirements
  - The goal is to not only reduce the number of calls to external service but also reduce the number of calls to Redis

### Not a good fit for
- Mutable cached entities
- Entities with short time to live (< 5 minutes)
- Cases when entities in local cache **must** outlive entities in distributed cache
  - Consider using only local cache instead
- Cases when all calls to Redis must be synchronized with distributed locks

## Ideas

- Use well-known Spring primitives for implementation
- Microservices environment needs to fit the requirement of fault tolerance:
  - Redis calls covered by [Resilience4j Circuit Breaker](https://resilience4j.readme.io/docs/circuitbreaker) which allows falling back to use local cache at the cost of increased latency and more calls to external services.
- Redis TTL behaves similar to `expireAfterWrite` in Caffeine which allows us to set randomized expiry time for local cache:
  - This is useful to ensure that local cache entries will expire earlier for a higher chance to hit Redis instead of performing external call.
  - This also implicitly reduces the load on the Redis by spreading calls to it over time.
  - In the case of Redis connection errors, randomized expiry and Circuit Breaker will help to mitigate [thundering herd problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundering_herd_problem).
- Expiry randomization follows the rule: `(time-to-live / 2) * (1 ± ((expiry-jitter / 100) * RNG(0, 1)))`, for example:
  - If `spring.cache.multilevel.time-to-live` is `1h`
  - And `spring.cache.multilevel.local.expiry-jitter` is `50` (percents)
  - Then entries in local cache will expire in approximately `15-45m`:
```
(1h / 2) * (1 ± ((50 / 100) * RNG(0, 1))) ->
30m * (1 ± MAXRNG(0.5)) ->
30m * RANGE(0.5, 1.5) ->
15-45m
```
